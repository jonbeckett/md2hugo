# md2hugo

I wrote this script largely for my own purposes, but thought the community might find use for it too. The script exports markdown files generated by wp2md into a collection of markdown files suitable for Hugo using the papermod theme (which requires title and date yaml in each post file).

If you lookup my other script - wp2md - it converts a Wordpress export into a collection of Markdown files. The result of that can then be picked up by this script to make those files suitable for hugo.
